In Mind: 
    - Embeds: 
        - Special builder to each type of embed (rich and poll_result already implemented)

Issues: 

Some Future Features without date to implement: 
    - Add automatic Tests(Like Vitest/Jest)
    - Create a website with documentation (Maybe use TypeDoc with github pages or my own website)
    - Add support to .txt and/or .md - utility to log messages
    - Add responsive css
    - Sticker Support
