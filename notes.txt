In Mind: 
    - Embeds: 
        - Special builder to each type of embed (rich and poll_result already implemented)

Issues: 

Todo: 
    - Remove all unecessary css in html.ts it will lightly benefit css in cdn and have little more kb on embedded css, but will make easier to maintan

Some Future Features without date to implement: 
    - Add automatic Tests(Like Vitest/Jest)
    - Create a website with documentation (Maybe use TypeDoc with github pages or my own website)
    - Add support to .txt and/or .md - utility to log messages
    - Add responsive css
    - Sticker Support
